        Today we will learn about 7 different tips to avoid scams and how to avoid catfishers online.
    </p>
    <p>
        Catfishers pretend to be someone you know and ask for your personal information.

    <p>
        VERIFY IDENTITY: Remember to verify that you are talking to a person you know or trust before giving out any
        private information.
    </p>
    <p>
        This can keep you safe from catfishes pretending to be a friend.

    <p>
        Look out for inconsistenies in accounts of a suspicious person. As seen in the example above, many catfishes
        make fresh accounts and are listed as new.

        Scammers will often tell you that your information is in danger, accounts have been hacked, or that you have won
        a prize. Do NOT blindly believe them. Do NOT click on the link!!

    <p>
        Do not trust everything that comes your way. People on the internet are not always who they say they are.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember to trust your instincts and follow the advice of a trusted person that is knowledegable on this topic.
    </p>
    <p>
        TIP: You can reverse image search images to check if they are using pictures from the internet.
