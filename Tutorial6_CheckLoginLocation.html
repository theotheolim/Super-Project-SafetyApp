        Welcome to Day 6!!
    </h2>
    <p>
        Today we will learn about checking account log in locations. We will use a Google Account as an example.
    </p>

    <p>
        Checking the log in locations will allow you to take action if an unrecognized device is using your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Doing this often will ensure an extra measure of security in case your account was breached.

        First, go to the Google homepage. Click on your profile icon on the top right corner.
    </p>

    <img src="\Super-Project-SafetyApp\TutorialPictures\2fa_2.png" height = "550" width="500">
    <p>
        Then click "Manage your Google Account".
    </p>
    </p>

    <img src="\Super-Project-SafetyApp\TutorialPictures\2fa_3.png" height = "500" width="470">
    <p>
        Click "Security" on the left. 
    </p>
    <hr>
    <img src="\Super-Project-SafetyApp\TutorialPictures\Day6.png" height = "550" width="520">
    <p>
        Scroll down until you see "Manage All Devices"
    </p>

    <p>
        Here you can see where and when your account was used and which devices had access to it.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        If there is an unrecognized location or device, immediately change your password, as you learned in Day 4.
    </p>
    <p>
        Doing this will log out your account on every single device, preventing data access from unauthorized people.
    </p>
    <p>
        REMINDER: Check the log in locations frequently to prevent any data breach!
