        Welcome to Day 6!!
    </h2>
    <p>
        Today we will learn about checking device and account login locations. This will be seen using a Google Account as an example.

    <p>
        Checking device and account login locations will allow you to take action if and unrecognized device is using your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Doing this every so often will ensure an extra measure of security in case your account was breached.

    <p>
        Here you can see where and when your account was used and which devices had access to it.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        If there is an unrecognized location or device, immediately change your password, as you learned in Day 4.
    </p>
    <p>
        Doing this will log out your account on every single device, preventing data access from unauthorized people.
    </p>
    <p>
        REMINDER: Check the log in locations frequently to prevent any data breach!
