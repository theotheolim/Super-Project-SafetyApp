        Here are some common tactics that scammers will use to trick people: 
    </p>
    <p>
        FEAR: By scaring the receiver, they will pressure the victim to give out their personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        URGENCY: They will tell the receiver that they need to take a certain action or else something bad will happen.
    </p>
    <p>
        GREED: They will say that the receiver won an award or prize and only needs to take one more step in order to win.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        REMINDER: Always be cautious when sent an unknown message or email, and always take any means necessary to ensure that it is safe.
