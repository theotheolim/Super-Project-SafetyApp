        We will learn about the Lock Screen in this lesson.

        Setting up the lock screen will secure your phone and require a passcode before entering onto your phone.
    </p>
    <p>
        For instance, if someone were to steal your phone, they would need to know the passcode before accessing your apps and information.

    <p>
        Setting up a passcode ensures an extra level of security to protect your private information from anyone who is able to use your phone.
